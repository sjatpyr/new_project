Software engineers, developers, and data scientists at most companies use GitHub daily to house their work, read each other's documentation, and collaborate across teams and organizations.

Recruiters, hiring managers, and senior engineers search through GitHub for potential job candidates. Your GitHub profile - activity, repos, commits, documentation - provides evidence that you're a skilled engineer.

For those who search for job -- one of the best ways to show off your work.
